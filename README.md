Code will run on Williams Gorgar machine with a Rev 100 or greater RPU board.  
At this time, the code above is the original Gorgar rules written for the Arduino. There is no custom scoring, sounds, or music. It's posted here as a starting point if anyone would like to create a new ruleset for Gorgar.
